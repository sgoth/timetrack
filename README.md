timetrack
====

A simple time tracking python script with wordy message output to track my work
time. It doesn't do much, but it sure is better than paper.

timetrack is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.

based on https://github.com/neverpanic/timetrack
vigorously adapted to my own needs in the most hacky way imaginable

don't trust anything in there - it's hack after hack to support what i need


## Warning

The upstream reports are mostly broken as i only use 'month' and that is implemented very differently.
